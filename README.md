# Bread-Quality-Check
Bread, being one of the oldest staple food items, is used by people throughout the world, and therefore has so many methods of ensuring quality control to guarantee consumer satisfaction, safety, and all other attributes like freshness, texture, taste, and safety (i.e., free from mold and other contaminants). Conventionally this quality control process has involved numerous eye inspections, which have been unreliable and usually wrought with human error. Hence, the effective use of IoT technology will be able to deliver enhanced bread monitoring and management from production to consumption.

But how does one ensure monitoring and control of such quality of bread in real-time, which eventually leads to problems like spoilage, waste, and even health risks to consumers? Existing means of quality control tend to favor the reactive over the proactive. Hence, bread goes on sale after it is no more fresh, and, worse still, wasted without any satisfactory justification

## Introduction 
This project focuses on using IoT-based sensors to monitor the internal environment of bread storage for early detection of spoilage. The system integrates MQ7 and MQ135 gas sensors to detect harmful gases such as carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚), which are often released during the decomposition process. The DHT11 sensor measures temperature and humidity, which are critical factors influencing mold growth and spoilage. Additionally, the AMG8833 thermal camera captures surface temperature variations, helping identify anomalies that may suggest fungal activity on the bread. By combining data from these sensors, the system aims to provide a comprehensive and real-time analysis of bread quality. Wheat bread is selected as the test subject for this project due to its widespread consumption and vulnerability to spoilage. This approach not only ensures food safety but also helps in reducing food waste by enabling timely intervention during the early stages of contamination or decay
